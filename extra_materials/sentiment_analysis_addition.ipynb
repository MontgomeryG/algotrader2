    "### Sentiment Analysis Addition \n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is not the main goal of this project. I see sentiment analysis as a future add on to improve the functionability of our program, but my current hypothesis is that it is NOT the most important thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating the sentiment analysis portion, we should attempt to use the more sofisticated ranking system. Rather than simply classifying the news release into 3 categories--good, neutral, bad--we create a score ranging from low 1 to high 10. How do we define a news headline to have a sentiment score of 10? Well, using past data maybe we can connect the news releases to the reaction of the market participants trading the stock whose company released the news. Depending on the price action of the ticker at the time of release, we can group each reaction into categories, using factors like 'how fast it went it' or 'how much percent did it go up' or 'how much did volume increased'. So, a news release that led a stock to shoot up 100% within the first hour and then continued up for the rest of the day ending the day up 300%, would be placed close to the high of 10 on our sentiment scale. An example of a news release that would be closer to 1 on our scale could be a very negative news catalyst that makes a stock lose +40% of it's value instantly; negative trial results on a biotech company that only had one goal--to see if they could get positive test results. \n",

    "We would employ this sentiment analysis on company news releases, live chats, the broader web.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For future use, here are some news released categorized by the expected reaction of market participants:\n",
    "\n",
    "PRICE GOES UP:\n",
    "- Inducement grant approved to BUY a certain amount of shares.\n",

    "- Company Announces quarterly cash dividend (short immediately).\n",
    "- Announces new line of credit, still having others to pay off.\n",
    "- Announces Inducement grants, offering stock to certain entities. They sell, so the price decreases often.\n",
    "- Recall announcements.\n",
    "- Company to acquire another company. They must raise capital somehow.\n",
    "- Company is being taken to or taking someone to court.\n",

    "- “Company plans to combine their medicine with another company’s medicine.”\n",
    "- Company wins a random award granted by a random company.\n",
    "- Inducement grants (they are offering out more stock for specific people to buy), this caused the stock to go up a bit, then right back down the day after the release.\n",
    "- Company announces acquisition of smaller company. This could be good for the price, as the company is getting bigger, but also it costs money to buy the smaller company, so the buyer may need to go to the public shares to raise that capital.\n",
    "- Company signs long-term supply agreement with other company (even important products such as chips; not that much of a reaction).\n",
    "- Philanthropy. Giving out money to help does not sound good for profits, but sometime a release will come out that a company is doing so but their stock continues to rise.\n",
    "- EARNINGS: Raised Guidance, Revenue significantly better than expected, Improved Margins.\n",
    "- Company plans to invest X amount in something with or without another company. Investing means they need capital right?\n",
    "- First patient enrolled in Phase 1 Trial.\n"
